# Graph_Algorithms_in_Biological_Pathway_Analysis  

Guidelines:  

This assignment bridges the gap between theoretical computer science and practical applications in molecular sciences and computational biology. Through this project, you will:

Develop expertise in a specialized algorithm or data structure used in scientific computing
Practice technical communication skills essential for interdisciplinary collaboration
Gain experience implementing algorithms for real-world biological problems
Learn from peers about diverse computational approaches in the life sciences
Core Components
Recorded Presentation (5 minutes)

Clear explanation of your chosen algorithm or data structure
Discussion of its relevance to molecular sciences/computational biology
Visual aids (slides, animations, or diagrams) to support understanding
Real-world application example from scientific literature
Implementation Demonstration

Working code in Python (Jupyter notebook preferred)
Well-commented implementation of the algorithm/data structure
Sample dataset or test case from a biological context
Performance analysis or comparison (if applicable)
README file with setup instructions and dependencies
Content Requirements
Your presentation and implementation should address:

Theory: Mathematical or logical foundation of the algorithm/data structure
Complexity: Time and space complexity analysis
Application: Specific use case in molecular sciences or computational biology
Advantages/Limitations: When to use (and not use) this approach
Demonstration: Working example with biological data
